# BlackSponge Media Player

I wanted to build my own video player so here we are. It doesn't meant to be anything except maybe light and with small dependency.

For now there is no documentation but as it still a work in progress, don't panic there may be one someday.

## License

I'm too lazy to create a special file for this now so I will put it there.

This project is under the license described in the two following articles :
 1. Basicly do whatever you want with my projet, I clearly don't care.
 2. If someday you hurt someone with it puppies will die, somewhere.
